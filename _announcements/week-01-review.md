# 🐣 Week 1: Intro to Python 3

<span style="color:green">_End of the week review_</span>

Happy Aloha Friday! 🌺

You successfully made it to the end of Week 1!🏝️ Congratulations!

I was informed this morning that there was an issue with the waitlist, so it stayed open much longer than we were expecting. 


This is a very fast-paced course, so you need to ensure that you are keeping track of the due dates and are proactively keeping up with (or staying ahead of) the course material. 
The material will build on itself every week, but things will get much easier with practice.

To accommodate students who were added late and give them a little more time for practice, the whole class gets the benefit of an extended deadline.🎊
Whatever progress you have made on the PA01, CA01, and the LA01 Checkpoint labs by the original **Friday, Aug 5, 11PM (PT)** deadline, a percentage of that score will be added to your grade as a bonus.🎊

Otherwise, Week 1 activities (PA01, CA01, LA01) are now going to be due together with the Week 2 activities (PA02, CA02, LA02 checkpoint labs).
I hope it helps everyone start this class with a solid foundation.

## ➡️    Staying on Track

[Looking ahead to Week 2]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-2), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Finish reading zyBooks Week 1 and Week 2 chapters
* Write down anything that's unclear and questions to ask during the class and/or in the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/) and/or on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}})
* Work on completing Week 1 lab activities (LA01)   

##  💎 Helpful tips 
* Do not try to go through the content as fast as possible - slow down and pay attention to what you are doing.
* Do not spend more than two hours in a row working in zyBooks. Use the [Pro tip that we shared with you]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success/#convert-pseudocode-to-code).
* Do not try to memorize everything! This class has an open-book and open-notes policy, so do not hesitate to use them for reference.
* We will work with strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries a lot in the following weeks, so we will revisit them again.
* Get a sense of what each data structure (the data type) does by noticing their similarities and differences (use the table on the slides or [on the website]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/data-structures)).
* The “📎 Quick access” notes within the zyBooks sections point you to the resources you will definitely need to reference, so make a note of them.

Welcome to the course! We look forward to a great quarter and to working with you!
