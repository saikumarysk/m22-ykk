Hi! My name is Kev. I love this class and mentoring in general. If I can make an impact in your life as a student or an individual then I will feel I've succeeded this quarter. I am extroverted and excited to be helping out with this course. I am easy to talk to and would hbe happy to help with anything that you want. My hobbies include travelling, movies, and working. I love what I do and do what I love. Take advantage of my OH. I have an undergrad in Computer Science and as of 2022, a Master's in Technology Management. If you want to learn more about either program or just want to chat about career or life in general, then I am here for it. Can't wait to join the party. I have done a little bit of most things including reasearch and working in Software Development.
