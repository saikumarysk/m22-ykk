Hi everyone! I am really excited about teaching this class again, since every time we offer it, we learn something new about how to present the introductory Computer Science concepts in a more intuitive, fun and/or creative way. 

When I am not sharing my passion for Computer Science and Data Science, you can find me drinking copious amounts of tea and exploring various hobbies.

This term, I'm going to be on the other side of the world (11 time zones ahead of Santa Barbara), but I look forward to using the power of CS (read: the Internet :-)) to stay connected with all of you and help you learn.
