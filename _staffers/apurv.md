Hi everyone! My name is Apurv and I am a second-year graduate student in the CS department. I am currently working in the Bionic Vision Lab on AR/VR projects to solve blindness and low vision. In my free time I do photography and play Tennis (always ready for a match!). I am also big F1 fanatic (very much looking forward to this years championship).

I also did my undergrad in CS and still remember how overwhelmed I was when I took my first programming course. So, feel free to reach out to me and remember there are no 'stupid' questions. Hope you guys have a great time learning this course!
