Hello! I am Raphael, a third-year Ph.D. student in the ECE department. I am currently working at the Vision Research Lab (VRL) with Professor Manjunath, doing research in Computer Vision, more especifically Human-Object Interactions.

I did my B.S. and M.S. back home in Porto Alegre, Brazil (fun fact: people born in my state are called Gauchos!)
On my free time I'm most likely at the rec cen, playing video games (currently playing Final Fantasy 7R and next in line is Horizon Forbidden West), exploring around, or planning/going on trips.

Learning how to program can feel completely alien and overwhelming very often, and we are here to help you have a smooth ride, so don't hesitate to reach out anytime you need any support. But if you are feeling shy, remember that Piazza has an annonymous posting feature :D
